ULTRASONIC DISTANCE MEASUREMENT PROJECT

The objective of this program is to build a code for portable Ultrasonic Distance Measurement device. 
The core functionality of the device will be perimeter detection of objects
in four directions (Front, Back, Left and Right). Four ultrasonic sensors will be utilized to continuously
detect objects and measure the distance from the device. Of the object detected by the device, the closest
object will take precedence and will be displayed on an LCD module indicating the direction and distance
of the object. The distance displayed shall be measured in both metric and imperial units which can be
selected using a switch on the device. To enhance user usability distance displayed will also have automatic
unit conversion for distances greater than 100 cm or 12 inches to meters and feet respectively depending
on the selected distance unit. In addition to the LCD display, LED will also light up in the direction of the
closest object for immediate visual verification. An audible verification (buzzer sound) will also be
implemented to notify the user when any object gets closer than 15 cm or 6 inches.. In accordance to 
the main functionality of the device stated above, user will also be able to enhance device accuracy by
selecting the calibration mode to reduce and adjust the margin of error that may be present for each sensor.
